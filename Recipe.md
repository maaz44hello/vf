HOW TO MAKE VANILLA CAKE

1. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl, then whisk together and set aside. Sifting the dry ingredients helps prevent lumps that would weigh down the batter.

2. Cream the butter and then add the sugar. The mixture should look pale yellow and fluffy when done.

3. Add the vanilla, then eggs one at a time. Scrape the bowl down in between so everything is evenly mixed.

4. Add the flour in three batches alternating with the buttermilk to help the butter mixture combine evenly and avoid over-mixing the batter.

5. Once the batter is almost combined, manually fold in any remaining butter/flour using a spatula to prevent over-mixing. Then, divide the batter equally between the two pans.

6. Bake for 30 minutes or until the edges pull away from the pan. Allow to cool in the pans for about two minutes, then invert layers onto a cooling rack, remove the paper, and set them aside to cool completely.

7. Make the buttercream frosting by creaming the butter, salt, and sugar before drizzling in the cream and vanilla. The buttercream frosting should form a soft peak with a slight curl, meaning it’s not too stiff to frost the cake effortlessly.

8. Frost your layered cake however you’d like and enjoy.
